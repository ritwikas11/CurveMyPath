How \nto get to the university in the least time is a simple optimization \nproblem that we encounter every morning. \nJust looking around ourselves we can see many examples of \noptimization problems even with conflicting objectives and \nhigher complexities. It is natural to want everything to be as \ngood as possible, in other words optimal. The difficulty arises \nwhen there are conflicts between different goals and objectives. \nIndeed, there are many real-world optimization problems with \nmultiple conflicting objectives in science and industry, which are \nof great complexity. We call them Multi-objective Optimization \nProblems. \n\nEnglish courtesy translation.  \nThe German version is legally binding \nTable of Contens Part A \n (Winter) \nPage 226 – Part B \n \nTable of Contents Part B \n(Complete) \n \nOver the past decade, lots of new ideas have been investigated \nand studied to solve such optimization problems as any new \ndevelopment in optimization which can lead to a better solution \nof a particular problem is of considerable value to science and \nindustry. Among these methods, evolutionary algorithms are \nshown to be quite successful and have been applied to many \napplications. \nThis course addresses the basic and advanced topics in the area \nof evolutionary multi-objective optimization and contains the \nfollowing content: \n- Introduction to single-objective optimization (SO) and \nmultiobjective \noptimization (MO), classical methods for solving MO, \ndefinitions of Pareto-optimality and other theoretical \nfoundations for MO \n- Basics of evolutionary algorithms (algorithms, operators, \nselection mechanisms, coding and representations) \n- Evolutionary multi-objective algorithms (NSGA-II, EMO \nscalarization methods such as MOEA/D) \n- Large-scale EMO: large scale decision space and many \nobjective \noptimization (such as NSGA-III) \n- Constraint handling in SO and MO, robust optimization in EMO, \nsurrogate methods for expensive function evaluations \n- Dynamic EMO \n- Evaluation mechanisms (Design of experiments, test problems, \nmetrics, visualization) \n \nType of examination: \nTo pass the examination or obtain a certificate, the following \nrequirements must be met: \n- Regular attendance and participation in lectures and exercises \n- Acquisition of the admission requirements for the written \nexam \n- Passing the written exam, 120 min. \nThe admission requirements can consist of various elements, \ne.g. solving and presenting exercises or passing an intermediate \nexam in the semester. \nThe exact admission requirements will be announced at the \nbeginning of the lecture, at the latest by the end of the third \nweek of lectures, on the chair's website. \n \n \nMedia: \n \nLiterature: \n- Deb, Kalyanmoy.

Nowadays hundreds of millions of people use \ninformation systems every day when they use a web store, a \nsearch engine or manage their e-mails. \nAt the moment information discovery plays an important role \nfor managing data collections, processing and identifying \nrelevant data, and supporting users analyzing their personal \ninterests (e.g. context, language, semantics, etc.). \nData Engineering principles are important for representing, \npresenting and understanding data that is generated by \ndifferent systems. Knowledge Engineering refers to all aspects \ninvolved in building, maintaining and using knowledge-based \nsystems to turn passive data into exploitable knowledge. \nIn this course the fundamentals of Data and Knowledge \nEngineering will be presented. The information system \narchitecture will be explained within all its components and \nrelated application areas will be discussed. The basic concepts \nand more advanced techniques for natural language processing, \ninformation filtering and decision support will be shown. \nFurthermore, in-depth knowledge and competences in Data \nScience / Data Mining will be given. \nAll the methods and techniques can be applied in Digital \nHumanities. This is an interdisciplinary environment, where \nresearchers can work together. It is based on different research \nfields, e.g. quantitative text analysis, information retrieval, text \nmining, subject-specific databases, corpus linguistics, \nvisualization of complex data structures and provides user-\noriented / user-centred representations of the data that can \nthen be further analysed hermeneutically in the humanities. \nAt the end of the course, the students are provided within a rich \nand comprehensive catalogue of tools and techniques and can \ndevelop and understand information systems applying their \nknowledge for Data and Knowledge Engineering. They can also \nuse machine learning techniques that can be applied for \ndifferent purposes, especially for digital humanities. \n \nType of examination: \n \nPrerequisite for exam will be announced at beginning of \nsemester. \nExam: written examination \n \n \nMedia: \n \nLiterature:"
