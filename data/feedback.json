    "feedback": "The interface is clean and user-friendly, with a straightforward structure that makes navigation easy.I recently came across CurveMyPath while exploring study options, and as someone aspiring to become a data scientist, I found it incredibly helpful. I was initially unsure about which subjects to focus on, but this platform made the path much clearer. It even highlighted subjects like Data Scientist with R and Swarm Intelligence, which I hadn\u2019t noticed on the university website at first glance. Overall, it really simplified my planning process."
